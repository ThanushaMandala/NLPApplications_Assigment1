2. **Fill in the paper details**:
   - Paper Title (required)
   - Authors (comma-separated)
   - Journal Name
   - Year of Publication
   - Cited Papers (comma-separated titles)
3. **Click "Add Paper"** to submit

### Uploading Data Files

#### CSV Format
Use the following CSV structure:
```csv
title,authors,journal,year,cited_papers
"Paper Title","Author 1, Author 2","Journal Name",2023,"Cited Paper 1, Cited Paper 2"
```

#### JSON Format
Use the following JSON structure:
```json
[
    {
        "title": "Paper Title",
        "authors": ["Author 1", "Author 2"],
        "journal": "Journal Name",
        "year": "2023",
        "cited_papers": ["Cited Paper 1", "Cited Paper 2"]
    }
]
```

### Querying the Knowledge Graph

#### Author Papers Query
1. **Go to the "Author Papers" query tab**
2. **Enter an author name**
3. **Click "Find Papers"** to see all papers by that author

#### Citation Analysis
1. **Go to the "Citations" query tab**
2. **Enter a paper title**
3. **Click "Find Citations"** to see citation relationships

#### Influential Papers
1. **Go to the "Influential Papers" query tab**
2. **Click "Get Most Influential Papers"** to see highly-cited research

### Graph Visualization Controls

- **Zoom In/Out**: Use zoom buttons or mouse wheel
- **Reset View**: Return to original view
- **Toggle Labels**: Show/hide node labels
- **Layout Options**: Switch between force-directed and circular layouts
- **Node Interaction**: Click nodes to highlight connections
- **Drag Nodes**: Drag to reposition nodes manually

## API Endpoints

The application provides RESTful API endpoints:

- `GET /api/papers` - Get all papers
- `POST /api/papers` - Add a new paper
- `POST /api/upload` - Upload CSV/JSON file
- `GET /api/query/author/<author_name>` - Query papers by author
- `GET /api/query/citations/<paper_title>` - Get citation information
- `GET /api/graph` - Get complete graph data
- `GET /api/influential` - Get most influential papers

## Sample Data

The repository includes sample data files:

- `sample_data.csv` - CSV format with NLP/ML papers
- `sample_data.json` - JSON format with Graph Neural Network papers

You can upload these files to quickly populate the knowledge graph and explore the features.

## Technical Architecture

### Backend (Flask)
- **Flask**: Web framework for API and routing
- **NetworkX**: Graph data structure and algorithms
- **Pandas**: Data processing for file uploads
- **Python**: Core application logic

### Frontend
- **HTML5/CSS3**: Modern, responsive interface
- **D3.js**: Interactive graph visualization
- **JavaScript**: Client-side interactivity
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout

### Data Model
- **Nodes**: Papers, Authors, Journals
- **Edges**: Citations, Authorship, Publication relationships
- **Metadata**: Year, journal information, author lists

## Use Cases

### Research Influence Mapping
- **Track citation patterns** across academic papers
- **Identify influential research** in specific domains
- **Analyze collaboration networks** between authors
- **Explore knowledge flow** through citation chains

### Academic Research Tools
- **Literature review assistance** by visualizing paper relationships
- **Research trend analysis** through temporal citation patterns
- **Author impact assessment** via publication and citation metrics
- **Journal influence mapping** across different research areas

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port already in use**: Change the port in `app.py`
2. **File upload fails**: Check file format (CSV/JSON only)
3. **Graph not loading**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors
4. **Missing dependencies**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
